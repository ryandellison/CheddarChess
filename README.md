## About

CheddarChess is a chess game with a twist.

This game was created for CS321 @ George Mason.

## Rules

The main rules to CheddarChess are as follows:

- Capturing an opponents pawn rewards you with one point, for a total of 8 points! (Protect your pawns!)
- Points can be spent bringing back a players piece that has been captured and put in its graveyard.
  - KNIGHTS: Cost 3pts
  - ROOKS & BISHOPS: Cost 4pts
  - QUEENS: Cost 8pts (Save up!)
- A piece that has been brought back can be put on any open space on the players first two rows.
- Getting your pawn to the other side of the board does nothing, don't waste your time.
- You cannot castle or do any other fancy chess moves.
